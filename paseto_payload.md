### Payload Breakdown

1. **exp (Expiration Time)**:
    - `"exp" => "2024-08-13T00:52:28Z"`
    - This indicates the time when the token expires. After this time, the token is no longer considered valid.
    - The format is in ISO 8601, and the `Z` at the end indicates that the time is in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time).
    - In this case, the token expires on **August 13, 2024, at 00:52:28 UTC**.

2. **iat (Issued At Time)**:
    - `"iat" => "2024-08-12T03:52:28+03:00"`
    - This represents the time when the token was issued.
    - The time zone is `+03:00`, indicating that the time is three hours ahead of UTC.
    - The token was issued on **August 12, 2024, at 03:52:28 local time** (UTC+3).

3. **nbf (Not Before Time)**:
    - `"nbf" => "2024-08-12T03:52:28+03:00"`
    - This claim specifies the time before which the token must not be accepted for processing.
    - It means that the token is not valid before this timestamp.
    - The token becomes valid on **August 12, 2024, at 03:52:28 local time** (UTC+3).

4. **user_id**:
    - `"user_id" => "1"`
    - This claim indicates the ID of the user associated with the token.
    - In this case, the user ID is `"1"`, which typically corresponds to a unique identifier in your database.

### Summary

- **Expiration (`exp`)**: Defines when the token is no longer valid. This is crucial for security, as it limits how long the token can be used.
- **Issued At (`iat`)**: Provides a timestamp for when the token was created. This can help track when the token was generated.
- **Not Before (`nbf`)**: Ensures that the token is only valid after a certain time. This prevents the token from being used before it's intended to be active.
- **User ID (`user_id`)**: Associates the token with a specific user. This allows the application to identify which user the token belongs to.
